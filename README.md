# slackbulkinvite
Add all members to a Slack channel
Go to Slack on your desktop via Chrome/Firefox. 
Go to the channel where you would like to add all users, right click, "Inspect," click on "Console," and paste the Slack bulk invite script. 
You will see the scipt working as it goes through each letter of everyone's name. You may need to paste the script a few times until everyone is added. You will know everyone is added when the number of members equals the number of members in the channel "Announcements," as that channel contains every current Slack member. 
Care, this script also invites bots, such as "IFTTT." Also, please use only when necessary as we don't want to add people to an unlimited amount of channels against their will.
